Title: Reconstructing Sample-specific Differential Gene Regulatory Networks Based on Mutual Information
Version: 1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(
    person(given = "Songwei",
           family = "Ai",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "aisongwei@shu.edu.cn"),

Description: The package is used to reconstruct a sample (or cell) specific differential gene regulatory networks
    based on mutual information from bulk RNA-seq (including microarrray) or single cell RNA-seq.
