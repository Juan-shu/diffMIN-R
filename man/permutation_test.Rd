\title{Permutation test for comparing means between two groups}
\usage{
permutation_test(x, y, B = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing group A}

\item{y}{A numeric vector representing group B}

\item{B}{Number of permutations to perform (default = 1000)}
}
\value{
p-value indicating the significance of the observed difference
}
\description{
This function conducts a permutation test to compare the means of two groups.
It calculates the observed difference in means between group A and group B,
generates permuted samples to simulate the null distribution, and computes
the p-value based on the proportion of permuted samples that exhibit a
difference in means as extreme as or more extreme than the observed difference.

# Example usage:
# x <- c(1.2, 3.5, 2.8, 4.1)
# y <- c(2.5, 1.8, 3.2)
